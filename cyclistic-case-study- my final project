Since then, the program has grown to a fleet of 5,824 bicycles that\nare geotracked and locked into a network of 692 stations across Chicago. The bikes can be unlocked from one station and\nreturned to any other station in the system anytime.\nUntil now, Cyclistic’s marketing strategy relied on building general awareness and appealing to broad consumer segments.\nOne approach that helped make these things possible was the flexibility of its pricing plans: single-ride passes, full-day passes,\nand annual memberships. Customers who purchase single-ride or full-day passes are referred to as casual riders. Customers\nwho purchase annual memberships are Cyclistic members.\nCyclistic’s finance analysts have concluded that annual members are much more profitable than casual riders. Although the\npricing flexibility helps Cyclistic attract more customers, Moreno believes that maximizing the number of annual members will\nbe key to future growth. Rather than creating a marketing campaign that targets all-new customers, Moreno believes there is a\nvery good chance to convert casual riders into members. She notes that casual riders are already aware of the Cyclistic\nprogram and have chosen Cyclistic for their mobility needs.\nMoreno has set a clear goal: Design marketing strategies aimed at converting casual riders into annual members. In order to\ndo that, however, the marketing analyst team needs to better understand how annual members and casual riders differ.\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# **Buiseness
